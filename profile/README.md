## 🌟 Main Features of Warzone Cheat

### 🎯 Aimbot

Our Aimbot module delivers precision shooting by automatically locking onto enemy targets. Key highlights include:

* Bone targeting (head, neck, torso)
* FOV customization
* Smoothing options for legit vs rage mode
* Visibility checks
* Silent aim support

### 🔍 ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)

See everything before your enemies do. The ESP overlay displays:

* Player boxes and skeletons
* Health, armor, weapon info
* Loot highlights (rare, legendary items)
* Distance indicators
* Nameplates and team color tags

### 🛋 Wallhack

This module enhances visibility through obstacles by:

* Highlighting enemies behind walls
* Displaying hidden loot
* Rendering terrain and objects transparently
* Offering toggleable vision layers

### 🔫 Triggerbot

Increase your reaction speed with Triggerbot, which automatically fires when your crosshair is over a valid target. Key features:

* Adjustable delay for realism
* Firing control based on weapon type
* FOV-limited targeting

### 🌪 No Recoil

Warzone’s recoil system is realistic, but that realism can be optimized. Our No Recoil script:

* Eliminates vertical and horizontal kick
* Simulates hand adjustments to avoid detection
* Customizes patterns per weapon loadout

### 🔐 HWID Spoofer

Bypass hardware bans with a built-in **HWID Spoofer** that:

* Spoofs motherboard, GPU, drive, and network identifiers
* Offers randomized profiles or custom config
* Ensures persistent spoofing across restarts
* Includes detection checkers and cleanup scripts

### 🏋 Unlock All Tool

Gain access to every cosmetic item, including:

* Operator skins
* Weapon blueprints
* Attachments and camos
* Calling cards and emblems
* Limited-time and seasonal gear

## 🌟 Why Use Warzone Cheat?

Using the **Warzone Cheat** package brings numerous advantages:

### 🔧 Anti-Ban Measures

HWID Spoofer ensures you can keep playing even after hardware bans. The cheat supports external mode for minimal detection risk.

### 🎓 Learning & Research

Explore reverse engineering, Windows API, overlay rendering, and anti-cheat evasion techniques in a real-world AAA game environment.

## 🔍 Technical Overview

This Warzone Cheat project uses a combination of advanced techniques to maintain effectiveness and reduce detection risk:

* **External Memory Reading:** No injection required
* **DirectX 11 Overlay:** Undetectable visual rendering
* **Kernel-Mode Drivers (optional):** For low-level spoofing and access
* **Virtual Input Simulation:** Bypasses standard mouse/keyboard hooks
* **Encrypted Configuration Files:** Protect your profiles and preferences
